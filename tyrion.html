Tyrion's mother, Joanna Lannister, died giving birth to him, a tragedy which Tywin and Cersei unfairly blame Tyrion for.[2][3]

Tyrion is mocked for being a dwarf, called derisive names such as "Imp" and "Halfman", which he tries to embrace to keep his self esteem up. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a commoner, he'd have been left in the woods to die; luckily, his birthright as a Lannister afforded him significant wealth and power

When Tyrion was sixteen, he interrupted the attempted rape of a wheelwright's daughter. While Jaime dispatched the attackers, Tyrion helped the girl, named Tysha, recover. They later became lovers and got married in secret. When Lord Tywin learned what had happened, he payed Tysha, a prostitute, to service every one of his guards while Tyrion watched. Jaime confessed he had orchestrated the attack to help Tyrion lose his virginity.

Tyrion accompanies King Robert Baratheon to Winterfell, where he makes the acquaintance of a prostitute named Ros, and gives her a Lannister lion necklace. While lingering outside the feast hall, Tyrion meets Jon Snow, Eddard Stark's bastard son and realizes he is something of a kindred spirit. "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes," he explains.[5] Despite time spent in brothels and taverns, Tyrion is well-read, cunning, and has a fondness for social misfits.
